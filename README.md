<h1>List<span style="color: red;">X</span> - Shopping Lists on another level </h1>


A free Tool to create Lists for every occasion.

These are the Developer Docs, if you were looking for the App itself, [click here](https://listx.io).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

 - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) A JavaScript runtime, in this case used as the Server side
 - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/listx/tutorial) _The_ Node Package Manager, you will need it to install all the Modules required to run the App
 - A Webserver, even if it's just your Laptop, you need something to run Node with
 - [MongoDB](https://mongodb.org) A JSON based NoSQL Database, which I happen to like alot

### Installing

You can use NPM to handle the installation for you, just type
```
$ mkdir ListXClone
$ cd ListXClone
$ npm install --save listx
```
into your servers terminal.

If you want to do it the old way, you can! (yippieee)

Again, open your servers terminal and use the following commands:
```
$ wget https://guithub.com/klequex/ListX/archive/master.zip -O ListXClone.zip
$ unzip ListXClone.zip
$ cd ListXClone
$ npm install
```

## Testing

TODO: deploy unit testing and continous integration

## Deployment

All [releases](./releases) are essentially ready-for-deployment. To run the App, you'll need a MongoDB Server up-and-running and you need to edit the file `test.config.json` the following way:
````
{
  "domain":"YOUR_DOMAIN",  <-- The domain, that will be used in emails
  "devMail":"YOUR_EMAIL", <-- An email address to let the developer know when the app restarts
  "cookieSecret":"SOME_RANDOM_TEXT", <-- The cookie secret, for the randomness, I recommend LastPass: https://lastpass.com/generatepassword.php
  "mailgun": {
    "privateKey":"YOUR_MAILGUN_KEY", <-- Set up an account with Mailgun and the the docs to find these: https://mailgun.com
    "domain":"YOUR_MAILGUN_DOMAIN"
  },
  "mongo": {
    "address":"YOUR_MONGO_ADDRESS" <-- this is the address of your MongoDB Server, including any authentication
  },
  "reCaptcha": {
    "privateKey":"G_RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY" <-- set up an account with Google reCaptcha: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin
  }
}
````
After that, rename the file to `config.json`.
